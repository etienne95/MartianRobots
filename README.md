# MartianRobots
Project to simulate martian robots displacement

*I used dictionaries for the topic of sine and cosine of trigonometric ratios, because the Math library of c # did not give me deterministic results, either when radians or not.*

## How to use it?

From root repository, run:

```
cd MartianRobots.Core
dotnet run
```

The result in the console should be:
```
1 1 E
3 3 N LOST
2 3 S
```

## Unit tests

From root repository, run:

```
cd MartianRobots.Tests
dotnet test
```

All tests should be passed
